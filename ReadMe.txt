== Description ==

Sticky Note can help you remember anything you write down. 
In that way, you won't have to deal with paper, trash or lost notes.
Once you have written them in Sticky Post, they stay there!

If you deactivate the plugin, the notes will not be deleted.
They are stored in your database, so when you activate the plugin again, they will appear as they were before deactivating the plugin.
